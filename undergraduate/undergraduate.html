<h1>Undergraduate</h1>
<p>The AAST minor program is intended for students who wish to develop a specialization in Asian American Studies alongside their degree pursuits. Participation in the minor program will endow students with knowledge, skills, and sensitivity towards cultural diversity that is vitally important in many career paths. A minor degree will be an important transcript or resume inclusion for any student pursuing employment in such fields as social services, education, business administration, human resources, public policy and law. Each May, AAST honors all graduates of the program at the Annual AAST Minor Graduation Ceremony.</p>
