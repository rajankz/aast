<h1>Research</h1>
<p>The Asian American Studies Program works with major organizations to examine the current state of Asian American communities in the United States. In 2008, through the partnership of the Organization of Chinese Americans (OCA), AAST published a major demographic and social profile, <a href="http://aast.umd.edu/chinese_americans.html">A Portrait of Chinese Americans</a>.
<br /><br />
In 2011, together with the National Council of Chinese Americans (NCCA), AAST released <a href="http://aast.umd.edu/newprofile_chinese_americans.html">A New Profile of Chinese Americans in the New Century</a>, a follow-up of A Portrait of Chinese Americans. These reports are references for major news publications and are important for public policy organizations interested in the needs of Chinese Americans.
<br /><br />
Today, AAST is proud to announce its most current report, <a href="http://aast.umd.edu/jaform.php">A Demographic Overview of Japanese Americans</a>, electronically published by AAST in partnership with the Japanese American Citizens League (JACL).  Each of these reports are available online through the AAST website.
