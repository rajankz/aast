			<p>A critical consideration of the moment and its aftermath - the political, legal, and civil rights repercussions for the communities most directly affected: South Asian, Arab, Middle Eastern, and Muslim American.</p>
			<p>As the tenth anniversary of September 11th, 2001 approaches, how can we reflect on that day and its aftermath when so many of the voices of affected communities remain unheard? In the interests of broadening the public conversation, The Asian American Literary Review (AALR) is publishing a special commemorative issue that gives voice to those too frequently unheard.</p>
			<p>Special Guest reading and events are slated for early September.</p>

The APALRC provides free legal assistance to low-income Asian immigrants who have limited English proficiency in a linguistically accessible and culturally appropriate manner.  It operates a multi-lingual legal intake helpline, a legal interpreter project, and provides legal assistance in immigration, domestic violence and family law, tenants' rights, and other areas.  The APALRC works to improve Asian AmericansÂ’ access to the legal system and to address the systemic inequities faced by Asian Americans and immigrants in our region.
