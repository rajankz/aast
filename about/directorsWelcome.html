People of Asian ancestry make up more than half of the world's population and more than 5 percent of the U.S. population. In our increasingly interdependent world, most of us interact with Asian Americans as business partners, professional colleagues, teammates, family members, and friends.</p>

<br /><p>Yet, many people do not understand the rich diversity of cultures found in a U.S. Census category that includes people from more than 30 Asian groups. That is why the Asian American Studies Program (AAST) offers an undergraduate minor for students who wish to develop a specialization in Asian American Studies alongside their major degree pursuits, whether in business, the sciences, or liberal arts.</p>

<br /><p>History, sociology, politics, film, literature, art, public policy, and more are studied in our classes. Our newest course offerings focus on Chinese Americans,Vietnamese Americans, and multiracial Asian Americans, but all Asian American groups are featured in our research and classwork.</p>

<br /><p>Using interdisciplinary courses, experiential learning, and independent studies, our students learn about the many Asian American communities in the D.C. metro area and nationwide. Field trips, distinguished guest speakers, and oral history projects keep our curriculum grounded in the reality of the Asian American experience.</p>

<br /><p>Please call, email or stop by our office, and ask us how you can get involved with Asian American Studies. We welcome your insights, your ideas and your participation.</p>

<br /><p>Sincerely,</p>
