<h2>Mission</h2>

<p>The Asian American Studies Program (AAST) at the University of Maryland provides students with the opportunity to critically study the experiences of Asian Americans. Through an interdisciplinary approach, students examine the histories, communities, and cultures of Asian Americans as both distinctive from and connected to the broader themes of diversity, ethnicity, race, gender, and migration in the Americas. AAST offers an undergraduate certificate for students who wish to develop a specialization in Asian American Studies alongside their degree pursuits.</p>
<br />
<p>The mission of AAST is to foster excellence in research and education about ethnic Asians in the United States. Asian American Studies inquires the lives, history, and culture of Asians from a comparative point of view. Our courses and research examine Asian American experiences as both distinctive and connected to the broader themes of diversity, ethnicity, race, and migration in the Americas. Specifically, we study persons who have immigrant and ancestral ties to any region of Asia and the Pacific.</p>
<br />
<p>Though there is no single Asian American identity, community, or experience, we believe that Asian American Studies provides a special opportunity for inquiry based on collaboration across fields and disciplines of academic study. A particular emphasis of our program is to teach about and to conduct research on underserved, neglected, and disadvantaged segments of Asian American communities.</p>
