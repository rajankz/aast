<h1>About Us</h1>
<p>The Asian American Studies Program (AAST) at the University of Maryland is one of the premier ethnic studies programs in the United States focusing on the identities and experiences of Asian Americans.
<br /><br />
Our program is uniquely positioned as an important venue for scholarship in Asian American ethnic studies with its close proximity to Washington, D.C., the fourth largest concentration of Asian Americans in the nation. Asian Americans are the largest ethnic minority group on campus, comprising 15 percent of the undergraduate student body. With nearly 500 students enrolled in our courses each semester and more than 60 students in our minor program, our curriculum is filling an important academic niche and serving the needs of our campus.
<br /><br />
AAST is striving to build a program as diverse as our community.
